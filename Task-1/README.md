# 🏡 House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)  

This project is part of **Prodigy Infotech Internship – Task 01**.  
The goal of this task is to **implement a Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on:  

- `sqft_living` (living area in square feet)  
- `bedrooms`  
- `bathrooms`

## 📂 Dataset  

Dataset: [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)  
- Contains house sales between May 2014 and May 2015 for King County, Washington (includes Seattle).  
- Includes over **21,000 house sales records**.  

Features selected:
- `sqft_living` → Size of the house in square feet  
- `bedrooms` → Number of bedrooms  
- `bathrooms` → Number of bathrooms  
- `price` → Target variable (house price)

## 📊 Final Results

- ✅ Dataset cleaned and preprocessed
- ✅ Linear Regression model trained
- ✅ Evaluation metrics (RMSE, R²) calculated
- ✅ Coefficients analyzed
- ✅ Example prediction tested
- ✅ Visualization plotted

## 🔎 Key Insights

- Square footage is the most influential feature.
- Bedrooms do not always add value — may reduce predicted price when sqft is fixed.
- Bathrooms add moderate value.
- Model is limited to 3 features, hence moderate accuracy.
